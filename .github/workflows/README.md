# LSTM_from_Scratch_Using_Keras

## The goal: 
Build a Recurrent Neural Network using Keras (with Tensorflow backend) from scratch using to LSTM algorithm to generate text, based on "Alice in Wonderland", written by Lewis Carroll.

## Generative Modeling using Deep Learning:
A generative model describes how a dataset is generated, in terms of a probabilistic model and by sampling from this model, we are able to generate new data.
Generative modeling is usually performed with an unlabeled dataset (i.e. a form of unsupervised learning), though it can also be applied to a labeled dataset to learn how to generate observations from each distinct class.
